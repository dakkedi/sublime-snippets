# sublime-snippets

Project for adding more flow to the workflow. 

Navigate to the Sublime Text folder and enter the packages folder. 

Import this project to either an already created folder or create one yourself (my folder is called 'sharedSnippets').

Now, all you need to do is start using the snippets.

# List of snippets

<ul>
  <li>remote_addr // gives the if-case with $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</li>
  <li>media-query-sass // Bootstrap media query with sass syntax</li>
  <li>acf // Advanced custom fields plugin with WP, using flexible content and repeater-field</li>
</ul>

I'll enter and update a list with all snippets here as we go.
